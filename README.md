# UFOs

## Purpose
Purpose of this analysis is to explain and demonstrate Javascript and its use cases. We will also demonstrate its built in functions, create and fill in a table using Javascript and HTML.
We will also convert Javascript functions to arrow functions in this project and also build for loops using Javascript. 
Overview of request is for client to display UFO data in a table stored as a Javascript array while being able to filter using multiple criteria.

## Summary: 

### Drawback:
One major drawback the user must know specific dates, cities, or shapes to be able to use the search function. Filters are also case sensitive and if the city does not exist in the
database then nothing will appear instead of a note saying no search results for that specific search. 

### Recommendations: 
1. Update the date function to let you search by month instead of exact date.

2. Allow search to use upper and lower case words to function.
